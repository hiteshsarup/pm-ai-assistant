# PRD Template Format

This document outlines the recommended format for Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) within Shipsy.

## 1. Introduction

Briefly describe the purpose of this PRD and the problem it aims to solve.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

Clearly state the measurable goals and objectives of the feature or product.

## 3. User Stories / Use Cases

Describe the functionality from the user's perspective. Use the format:

*   **As a** [type of user],
*   **I want to** [perform some task],
*   **so that** [I can achieve some goal].

## 4. Functional Requirements

Detail what the system *must* do. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

Specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors (e.g., performance, security, usability).

## 6. Technical Considerations

Outline any technical constraints, assumptions, or architectural decisions.

## 7. Open Questions / Future Considerations

List any unresolved questions or potential future enhancements.
