      "content": "To create a PRD for a bulk upload functionality, you may consider including the following sections and aspects:\n\n### Title: Bulk Upload Functionality\n\n#### 1. **Objective**\n   - Enable users to upload multiple delivery records simultaneously to improve efficiency and reduce manual data entry time.\n\n#### 2. **Scope**\n   - This feature will allow users to upload CSV/XLSX files containing trip and delivery data into the transportation management system (TMS).\n\n#### 3. **Requirements**\n\n##### 3.1 Functional Requirements\n- **File Format**: Accept CSV and XLSX file formats.\n- **Data Validation**: Validate the uploaded file for required fields (e.g., Trip Date, Transporter Name, Vehicle Number).\n- **Error Handling**: Notify users of any validation errors, specifying which records need correction.\n- **Success Confirmation**: Provide a summary of successful uploads and a detailed report of any errors.\n- **Mapping Fields**: Users should be able to map the columns from the upload file to the system's database fields before submission.\n\n##### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: The system should handle bulk uploads of at least 500 records within 2 minutes.\n- **Security**: Ensure that file uploads are scanned for viruses and malware.\n\n#### 4. **User Interface**\n- **Upload Button**: A prominent button on the dashboard for bulk upload.\n- **Mapping Interface**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to map their file columns to the system fields.\n- **Progress Indicator**: Show the upload process with a loading spinner/indicator.\n\n#### 5. **Acceptance Criteria**\n- Users can successfully upload a file and receive immediate feedback on its processing.\n- System rejects files with validation errors and provides clear messages.\n- Successfully uploaded records should appear in the delivery management dashboard.\n\n#### 6. **Dependencies**\n- Ensure integration with the existing database schema for new data entry.\n- Collaboration with the QA team for testing the functionality with various file formats.\n\n#### 7. **Timeline**\n- Estimate time for design, development, and testing phases.\n\n### Actionable Advice:\n1. Gather input from relevant stakeholders (end-users, developers, and QA) to refine requirements.\n2. Create wireframes/mockups for the user interface components.\n3. Plan a user acceptance testing (UAT) phase to validate the functionality with real-world scenarios.\n\nFeel free to adjust any specific details based on your team's needs!"
