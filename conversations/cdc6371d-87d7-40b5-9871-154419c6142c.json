By implementing an upload functionality, we can enable users to efficiently input large volumes of consignments through a user-friendly interface, improving data accuracy and operational efficiency.\n\n### 2. Objective\nTo develop a feature that allows users to upload consignment details in bulk using a standardized file format (e.g., CSV or Excel), streamlining the process of registering consignments in the Shipsy system.\n\n### 3. Requirements\n\n#### 3.1 User Stories\n- As a user, I want to upload a file containing consignment details so that I can quickly add multiple consignments at once.\n- As an administrator, I want to ensure that the uploaded data is validated for accuracy to avoid processing errors.\n\n#### 3.2 Functional Requirements\n- **FR1:** The system shall provide a user interface with an \"Upload Consignment\" button.\n- **FR2:** The system shall accept file uploads in CSV and Excel formats.\n- **FR3:** The system shall validate the uploaded file structure against predefined templates.\n- **FR4:** The system shall display a summary of valid and invalid entries after the upload, including error messages for any invalid data.\n- **FR5:** The system shall allow users to download a template file for entering consignment details.\n\n#### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements\n- **NFR1:** The system shall support file uploads of up to 10MB.\n- **NFR2:** The upload process should complete within 2 minutes for files of maximum size.\n- **NFR3:** The system must maintain data integrity and security during the upload process.\n\n### 4. Acceptance Criteria\n- The user can successfully upload a CSV/Excel file, and the data is reflected in the consignment database.\n- The system correctly identifies and reports invalid data entries.\n- Users can download the template file, which adheres to the specified structure.\n\n### 5. Dependencies\n- Integration with the existing database for validation and data storage.\n- User interface design and development resources.\n\n### 6. Timeline\n- **MVP Development:** [Start Date] - [End Date]\n- **Testing Phase:** [Start Date] - [End Date]\n- **Go-Live Date:** [Proposed Date]\n\n### 7. Stakeholders\n- Product Team\n- Engineering Team\n- Quality Assurance Team\n- Customer Support Team\n\n### 8. Risks\n- Potential resistance to change from existing users.\n- Data security concerns during the upload process.\n\n### 9. Metrics for Success\n- Reduction in time spent on data entry.\n- Increase in the number of consignments processed per hour.\n- User satisfaction score post-implementation.\n\n---\n\nPlease review this PRD and let me know if there are any adjustments or additional requirements you'd like to incorporate!"
