      "content": "Here is the detailed PRD based on Approach 2 for enabling Hub users to revoke an indent in Shipsy's indent flow:\n\n---\n\n### **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**\n\n#### **a. Problem Statement**\nCurrently, once an indent is active, only the vendor can reject it. Hub users from the Ops dashboard can only view the status through the \"Indent pending with\" field. This limitation does not allow Ops users to manage indents actively, leading to potential delays and inefficiencies in logistics management.\n\n#### **b. Summary Solution**\nImplement a revocation feature in the Ops dashboard that allows Hub users to revoke active indents. This feature will include a \"Revoke Indent\" button, the ability to provide a reason for revocation, and an automated notification system to inform both vendors and relevant stakeholders of the revocation.\n\n#### **c. Detailed Requirements**\n1. **User Interface Updates:**\n   - Add a \u201cRevoke Indent\u201d button in the Indent management section of the Ops Dashboard.\n   - On clicking the button, a modal should appear asking the user to input a reason for the revocation.\n   - The modal should contain:\n     - A text field for the reason (mandatory).\n     - A cancel and a confirm button.\n\n2. **Backend Changes:**\n   - Extend the existing Indent management service to include a new API endpoint for revoking indents: `POST /api/indent/revoke`.\n   - The endpoint should accept:\n     - `indent_id` (string): The ID of the indent to be revoked.\n     - `reason` (string): The reason for revoking the indent.\n   - When the endpoint is called, the system should:\n     - Validate that the indent can be revoked (i.e., it is in an active state).\n     - Update the status of the indent to \u201cRevoked\u201d.\n     - Store the reason for revocation in the database for auditing purposes.\n\n3. **Notification System:**\n   - Implement an automated notification system that sends out alerts to:\n     - The vendor associated with the revoked indent.\n     - The Hub user who initiated the revocation, confirming the action.\n   - Notifications should be sent via email and in-app notifications.\n\n4. **Audit Logging:**\n   - Log all revocation actions with details such as:\n     - Indent ID\n     - User ID of the Hub user who revoked the indent\n     - Reason for revocation\n     - Timestamp of the action\n\n5. **Testing:**\n   - Conduct testing to ensure users can revoke indents correctly.\n   - Validate that notifications are sent properly and that audit logs are correctly recorded.\n\n#### **d. Acceptance / Rejection Criteria**\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n  - A \u201cRevoke Indent\u201d button appears for active indents in the Ops Dashboard.\n  - Users can enter a reason for revocation and successfully revoke an indent.\n  - The indent status changes to \u201cRevoked\u201d in the system.\n  - Relevant stakeholders (vendors and users) receive notifications regarding the revocation.\n  - All revocation actions are logged accurately in the audit trail.\n\n- **Rejection Criteria:**\n  - If the \u201cRevoke Indent\u201d button does not appear or is not functional.\n  - If users are able to revoke indents without providing a reason.\n  - If notifications are not sent or received by stakeholders.\n  - If audit logs do not reflect the revocation actions accurately.\n\n---\n\nPlease review this PRD and let me know if you need any modifications or additional details!"
