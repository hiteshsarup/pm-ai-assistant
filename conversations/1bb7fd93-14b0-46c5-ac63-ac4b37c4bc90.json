      "content": "Here are a couple of approaches to implement the feature request that allows Hub users from the Ops dashboard to revoke an active indent:\n\n### Approach 1: Quick Fix\n**Description:** Add a \u201cRevoke Indent\u201d button in the Ops Dashboard for active indents that directly interacts with the existing backend logic to handle revocations. \n\n- **Pros:**\n  - Minimal development effort since it utilizes existing backend functionality.\n  - Quick to roll out and integrate into the current workflow.\n\n- **Cons / Trade-offs:**\n  - Limited to only revoking indents without additional context or management features (e.g., adding comments for why they revoked).\n  - Potential for confusion if Hub users are unsure of the implications of revocation on vendor assignments.\n\n- **Impacted Systems:**\n  - Operations Dashboard (UI updates to show Revoke option).\n  - Backend Indent management (additional endpoint or logic for revoking indents).\n\n### Approach 2: Generic\n**Description:** Modify the indent management system to implement a complete revocation workflow, allowing Ops users to not only revoke an indent but also to provide a reason for revocation, and subsequently notify relevant stakeholders (vendors, users, etc.).\n\n- **Pros:**\n  - Offers a more complete solution with better user experience by allowing contextual comments for revocation.\n  - Provides notifications and logs for auditing purposes, improving traceability.\n\n- **Cons / Trade-offs:**\n  - Higher development effort and longer time to implement.\n  - Complexity in handling notification workflows and maintaining the state of indents.\n\n- **Impacted Systems:**\n  - Operations Dashboard (UI/UX changes).\n  - Backend Indent management (updates for handling revocation reasons and notifications).\n  - Notification system (for alerting vendors and confirming users).\n\n---\n\nWhich approach would you like to expand on, or do you have another suggestion?"
