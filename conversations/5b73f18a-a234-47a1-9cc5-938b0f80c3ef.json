      "content": "To create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for this feature request, you can consider the following sections:\n\n### Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n**Title:** Visibility of Freight Cost at Trip Start\n\n**Objective:**  \nTo provide users with visibility of the freight cost when a trip starts, helping them better manage and anticipate expenses associated with transport logistics.\n\n**Background:**  \nCurrently, users do not have access to freight cost information at the beginning of a trip. By implementing this feature, users can make informed decisions regarding cost management and improve transparency for financial planning.\n\n**Feature Description:**\n\n- **User Story:**  \n  As a user, I want to see the estimated freight cost associated with a trip at the time of trip start, so that I can manage expenses effectively.\n\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n  1. The freight cost should be displayed on the trip dashboard/interface when a trip status changes to \"Started\".\n  2. The cost should include breakdowns for distance, trip count, and any applicable penalties or guarantees.\n  3. The displayed cost must be updated in real-time in case of changes to the trip details (e.g., changes in distance or additional penalties).\n  4. Users should have the option to view a more detailed report or breakdown upon clicking on the freight cost.\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- The backend should retrieve freight cost data based on the current trip parameters (distance, trip count, penalties) using existing pricing logic.\n- Update the front-end UI to display the freight cost in the trip summary area upon trip start event.\n- Ensure that this information is reliable and reflective of real-time data by implementing appropriate API calls.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n- The feature should not impact the application performance significantly.\n- The UI should be intuitive, ensuring that users can easily find the freight cost information.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- This feature may require collaboration with the backend team to ensure that freight calculation logic is available in the real-time data fetching process.\n- Considerations for UI/UX design to integrate the freight cost display seamlessly into the existing trip interface.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Gather feedback from stakeholders regarding the proposed feature.\n2. Review with technical teams to assess feasibility and resource requirements.\n3. Prioritize the development of this feature in the upcoming sprint.\n\nBy outlining the PRD this way, you will create a clear roadmap for implementing the requested feature. Would you like assistance with anything else regarding this PRD?"
