      "content": "Sure! The indent flow in Shipsy is designed to facilitate the request for vehicle and driver allocation from external vendors for both First/Last Mile (FLM) and Inter Stock Transfer (IST) trips. Here's an overview of the indent flow:\n\n### 1. Overview of Indent Flow\nAn indent represents a request sent to external vendors to assign a vehicle and driver for a trip. The process is structured to allow for both manual and automated handling of vendor assignments based on specific configurations.\n\n### 2. Trip Types\n- **FLM Trips (Endpoint Trips)**: Direct shipments where vehicle assignment occurs based on immediate transportation needs.\n- **IST Trips (Inter Stock Transfers)**: Internal movements that can involve multiple modes of transport, allowing for a slightly different flow.\n\n### 3. Indent Process Steps\n- **Configuration**: \n  - The `send_vehicle_requisition_request` flag controls whether the indent process is active.\n  - Other configurations determine thresholds for classifying trips (FTL vs. LTL) and enable specific actions.\n\n- **Trip Creation**:\n  - In the manual trip creation UI, when `send_vehicle_requisition_request` is enabled, users can select a Vendor along with a Vehicle Make, preparing an indent request.\n  - If the configuration allows, trips are held until a vendor confirms a vehicle assignment.\n\n- **Vendor Portal Interaction**:\n  - Vendors can view and respond to indent requests via the Vendor Portal, where they can accept or reject the requests.\n  - Notifications (SMS/email) are sent to vendors at each stage of the indent process, contingent on the `send_vehicle_requisition_request` flag being enabled.\n\n- **Handling of FLM and IST Trips**:\n  - **FLM Flow**: \n    - Requests are created, and vendors can accept/reject. Accepted requests will assign a vehicle and driver. Indents are typically used for FTL shipments.\n    - Indent metrics like `freight_type` and conversion metrics (e.g., `max_cumulative_product_value`) are recorded for reference.\n    \n  - **IST Flow**:\n    - The system looks for serviceable vendors based on predetermined route and vehicle type.\n    - The allocation for IST trips follows a similar pattern to that of FLM, allowing for outsourcing inter-hub movements to vendors based on specific configurations.\n\n### 4. Notifications & Alerts\n- Upon request cancellation, a DEREQUISITION alert SMS is sent to the respective vendor if the indent setting is active.\n- Every status change triggers corresponding notifications to keep all parties informed.\n\n### 5. Closing the Indent\nOnce the vehicle assignment is complete or a trip reaches its final stages, the system marks the indent as complete. If certain consignments are not unloaded, the system can track and manage further actions.\n\n---\n\nThis flow ensures efficient vehicle allocation while involving vendors closely, thereby enhancing the logistics process. If you need additional information or further clarification on any part of the process, feel free to ask!"

Please choose one to expand upon or propose another.\n\n### Approach 1: Quick-Fix\n- **Pros:**\n  - Leverages existing functionality for cancelling indents.\n  - Minimal development effort required; utilizes established API calls.\n- **Cons / Trade-offs:**\n  - User experience may be less polished, relying on a simple button without additional context.\n  - Limited ability to customize alerts or notifications related to indent revocation.\n- **Impacted Systems:**\n  - Operations Dashboard (UI)\n  - Backend API for cancelling indents\n\n### Approach 2: Generic (Long-term Solution)\n- **Pros:**\n  - Provides an intuitive interface for managing active indents, allowing for extra features (e.g., comments, reasons for revocation).\n  - Allows for better integration with future enhancements or reporting features.\n- **Cons / Trade-offs:**\n  - Higher development effort; may require more time and resources to implement.\n  - Additional complexity could lead to longer testing periods.\n- **Impacted Systems:**\n  - Operations Dashboard (UI)\n  - Backend API for cancelling indents\n  - Vendor Notification System (for informing vendors on revocation)\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know which approach you'd like to proceed with, or if you have another in mind!"

Problem Statement**  \nCurrently, there is no option available in the Ops Dashboard for users to revoke an active indent. This limitation can lead to miscommunication and mismanagement in situations where an indent needs to be cancelled or modified.\n\n**b. Summary Solution**  \nImplement a user-friendly interface on the Ops Dashboard that allows users to revoke active indents. This feature will enable users to provide reasons for revocation, improved tracking, and automated notifications to the relevant vendors. The feature will foster better communication and operational efficiency.\n\n**c. Detailed Requirements**  \n1. **User Interface**:\n   - Add a \"Revoke Indent\" button/modification option next to each active indent displayed in the Ops Dashboard.\n   - Upon clicking the button, a modal should prompt the user for:\n      - Reason for revocation (text input).\n      - Optionally, the ability to select the cancelation method (immediate or scheduled).\n   - Confirmation message to ensure the user confirms the revocation action.\n\n2. **Back-end Functionality**:\n   - Create an API endpoint to handle indent revocation. The endpoint should:\n     - Accept the indent ID and reason for revocation.\n     - Update the relevant indent status in the database.\n     - Trigger a notification to inform vendors about the revocation status.\n\n3. **Notifications**:\n   - Implement an automated SMS/email alert system to notify affected vendors upon indent revocation.\n   - Include details of the revocation (indent ID, reason for cancellation).\n\n4. **Tracking**:\n   - Maintain a history log in the backend to track all revocations, reasons provided, and time stamps for auditing purposes.\n\n5. **Testing**:\n   - Ensure thorough testing of UI components for cross-browser compatibility and usability.\n   - Perform API testing for reliability and performance under various loads.\n\n**d. Acceptance / Rejection Criteria**\n- **Acceptance Criteria**:\n  - Users can successfully revoke an active indent through the Ops Dashboard.\n  - The system records the reason for revocation.\n  - Notifications are sent to the specified vendors as expected.\n  - All implemented functionality passes QA testing.\n\n- **Rejection Criteria**:\n  - If any component of the feature does not function as specified.\n  - Inability to notify vendors correctly upon indent revocation.\n  - Any significant user experience issues identified during testing.\n\n---\n\nThis PRD outlines the framework for adding the revocation feature, ensuring the solution is both user-friendly and functionally effective. Let me know if you need any modifications or additional features included!"
