      "content": "Great! For the feature request of \"Bulk Upload of Trips\" in Shipsy, we can consider a few different approaches. Here are multiple options based on two modes: **Quick Fix** and **Generic**.\n\n### Quick Fix Approaches\n\n1. **CSV Import Functionality**\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Leverages existing file upload systems.\n     - Users are familiar with CSV formats, making it easy to adopt.\n     - Quick to implement with minimal frontend and backend changes.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Limited validation on data integrity during import.\n     - Might need an additional process for error correction for failed rows.\n   - **Impacted Systems**: Operations Dashboard, Trip Management API.\n\n2. **API Bulk Upload Endpoint**\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Allows integration with existing TMS setups, suitable for larger clients.\n     - Can handle larger dataset uploads than traditional file methods.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Requires API documentation and potential changes to existing client integration workflows.\n     - Careful design needed for rate limits and data handling.\n   - **Impacted Systems**: Trip Management API, Database.\n\n### Generic Approaches\n\n1. **Dedicated Bulk Upload Module**\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Provides a user-friendly interface guiding users in preparing and uploading batch files.\n     - Includes validation steps for file uploads to improve data integrity.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - More time-intensive development process.\n     - Requires more rigorous user testing.\n   - **Impacted Systems**: Operations Dashboard, Database, Trip Management API.\n\n2. **Excel Upload Support with Data Validation**\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Excel files can support complex data formats and validations.\n     - Provides a clear feedback mechanism on errors or warnings after upload.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - More complicated than CSV imports, which may deter some users.\n     - Additional library dependencies for parsing Excel files.\n   - **Impacted Systems**: Operations Dashboard, Trip Management API, Database.\n\n---\n\nPlease choose one of the approaches or propose your own, and I can help develop the final PRD!"
