      "content": "Creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a bulk upload functionality involves detailing the requirements, use cases, and specifications necessary for implementation. Here\u2019s a structured outline and some suggestions to get you started:\n\n### PRD Outline for Bulk Upload Functionality\n\n#### 1. **Overview**\n   - **Purpose**: Define the goal of the bulk upload feature. For example, \"To enable users to upload multiple records efficiently, enhancing data entry speed and accuracy.\"\n   - **Scope**: Specify the types of data that can be bulk uploaded (e.g., Transporter details, trip info, vehicle records).\n\n#### 2. **Requirements**\n   - **User Stories**:\n     1. As a user, I want to upload a CSV file containing multiple trip records to streamline the data entry process.\n     2. As a user, I want to receive feedback on the success or failure of my uploads for easier troubleshooting.\n\n   - **Functional Requirements**:\n     - File upload support (e.g., .csv, .xlsx).\n     - Validation checks (e.g., required fields, data formats).\n     - Error handling to provide detailed failure reports.\n     - Progress indicator during upload.\n\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements**:\n     - Performance: Bulk uploads should complete in under a defined time frame (e.g., 5 minutes for 1,000 records).\n     - Security: Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for viruses.\n\n#### 3. **Data Specifications**\n   - Define the expected structure of the upload file (e.g., headers, required columns).\n   - Example structure for a trip upload file:\n     ```\n     Trip No, Trip Date, Transporter Name, Vehicle Type, Pickup Address, Delivery Address, etc.\n     ```\n\n#### 4. **User Interface**\n   - Wireframes or mockups for the upload page, including:\n     - Drag-and-drop upload area.\n     - File format guidelines.\n     - Upload status messages.\n\n#### 5. **Error Messages & Handling**\n   - List common errors and responses (e.g., \"Invalid CSV format,\" \"Missing required field: Trip No\").\n   - Provide a download link for error reports.\n\n#### 6. **Acceptance Criteria**\n   - Define what success looks like. For example:\n     - Successful upload indicates no errors found in the CSV file.\n     - Users can upload a file with at least 100 records without performance issues.\n\n#### 7. **Testing Requirements**\n   - Outline testing strategies including:\n     - Unit testing for file validations.\n     - Integration testing with backend systems.\n\n### Action Items\n1. **Refine User Stories**: Work with stakeholders to ensure user stories capture all needs.\n2. **Data Structure**: Finalize the CSV structure with input from data management teams.\n3. **Define Error Handling**: Collaborate with development to create a list of common upload errors.\n4. **Prepare Mockups**: Create wireframes for the upload interface for visual clarity.\n\nFeel free to adapt any part of this outline as per your specific organizational needs.
