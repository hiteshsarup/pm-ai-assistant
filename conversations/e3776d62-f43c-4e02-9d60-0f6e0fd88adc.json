      "content": "Let's explore multiple approaches for creating a functionality that allows users to bulk upload Vendor details. Here are two possible approaches:\n\n### 1. Quick-Fix Approach\n- **Pros:** \n  - Leverages existing upload functionality (if available) to minimize development effort.\n  - Faster time to market since it builds on existing infrastructure.\n- **Cons / Trade-offs:**\n  - May not be extensible for future changes (like additional data fields).\n  - Could lead to issues if vendor details require validation beyond current capabilities.\n- **Impacted Systems:**\n  - Vendor Portal (web)\n  - Backend APIs involved in data processing and storage.\n\n### 2. Generic Approach\n- **Pros:**\n  - Extensible and can accommodate future needs (e.g., additional fields, formats).\n  - Better validation mechanisms can be put in place to ensure data integrity.\n  - Allows for feedback during the upload process, improving user experience.\n- **Cons / Trade-offs:**\n  - More development time and resources required.\n  - Requires more rigorous testing and validation processes.\n- **Impacted Systems:**\n  - Vendor Portal (web)\n  - Backend APIs for validation and data storage.\n  - User Notifications system for upload results and errors.\n\n### Next Steps\nWhich approach would you like to expand on, or do you have another approach in mind?"
